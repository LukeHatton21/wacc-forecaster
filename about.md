The tool uses the approach developed by IRENA in their benchmarking tool to explore future changes to the cost of capital at a national level, for given technologies. 

It estimates the cost of capital by splitting the overall cost into contributing risk factors, namely:

 * __Risk-free rate__: The global , representing the time value of money. Corresponds to the global macroeconomic interest rate environment.
 * __Country Risk__: The risk perception of investing in a given country from financial markets. Country risk estimates are taken from the work of Professor Damodaran at NYU, who evaluates them from sovereign bond credit rating or spreads between the national sovereign bond and US treasury bonds.
 * __Instrument Premium__: The risk premium for equity financing or the lender margin for debt financing. 
 * __Technology Risk__: Risks associated with  the market and technology being deployed in a given country. Estimated based on the maturity of the given technology in each national market, taken as the ratio of installed capacity to overall grid capacity.
