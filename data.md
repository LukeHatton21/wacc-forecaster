The project was led by Luke Hatton, in collaboration with Dr Malte Jansen, Dr Gbemi Oluleye, Dr Iain Staffell and Professor Adam Hawkes. A full in-depth methodology along with initial results was published at Scientific Data and can be found at the following link:

The full underlying data can be found at Zenodo (with relevant temporal or national selections also able to be downloaded directly from this webtool): *Historical and future projected costs of capital for ten energy technologies across 176 countries*, Luke Hatton, Iain Staffell, Malte Jansen, Gbemi Oluleye & Adam Hawkes, [https://zenodo.org/records/17076925](10.5281/zenodo.15227848)

Since publication, the model has been updated with 12 additional technologies and the scope of the short-term projections extended to 2034. Planned work includes expanding the scope of technologies covered and computing long-term projections based on the Shared-Socioeconomic Pathways used in integrated Assessment Modelling.
